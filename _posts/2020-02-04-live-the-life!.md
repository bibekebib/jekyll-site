Why take so much pressure?

When you can do so much the next day

The sun will shine for a reason

What must wake up is you!

<br>

The moment is now, the moment to live

Why worry when you are the one?

There is enough time per second

What must rise is the will in you!

<br>

I take nothing for granted

Why take a risk when unnecessary

There is life occupied in you

What must be broken is the walls!

<br>

The game is for the winners

Why lose the game when you can win

Sometimes, losers has the greatest spirit

What must be taken is the teachings!
