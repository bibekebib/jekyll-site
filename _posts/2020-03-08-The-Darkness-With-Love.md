3 in the clock, 3 hours still to alarm

When the sky flirting with stars

I saw you, in my goodnight dream

Just the way, you reside inside me.

                    -------

The silky arm of never lasting love

Extending from mine to your’s heart

The night engulfed in the windy chill

Me getting the warmth with our memories.

                    -------

The moon teasing me by your name

I feel the blush, what have you done?

Each second feels light-years, but

You in every year, I will ever live.

                    -------

The chirping, the grasshopper making

As if, it hasn’t slept, like I am

Why not yet? Waiting for the next day?

Like me, the big-day, we meeting, right!!

                    -------

Are you getting sleep? No! you too not

Exploring the art in darkness, the color of life

Portraying us in between the lights

Awaiting the moment, we live these long years.

                    -------

So many things to say, will we be able?

What if we talk in the language of silence?

What if the time just paralyzed in between

Eyes unmoved, mine for you and you’re for me!
